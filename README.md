My first project with API calls. It pulls the information open weather and sets it into the center area, as well as puts in the 5-day forecast. It calls to the a weather icons by using the icon number provided by open weather and using if statments to see which icon is appropriate. 

The project is incomplete as there is no search function and no local storage for saved searches.
